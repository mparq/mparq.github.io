		<div class="about">

			<p>I am currently a part-time student at the Georgia Institute of Technology and work full-time at a company called <a href="http://www.athenahealth.com/">athenaHealth</a> downtown in Ponce City Market. I am studying Computer Science and have previously worked as a Teaching Assistant for a class called CS 2316 - An introduction to data manipulation. I enjoy teaching and also take on tutoring jobs on the side. If you're interested, let me know.</p>

            <p>Aside from work, I enjoy playing and watching sports and enjoying nice days outdoors. I live in Atlanta - the city has always been my home and my favorite city. One of my biggest hopes is that one day I will see an Atlanta sports team win a championship, but I won't hold my breath.</p>
